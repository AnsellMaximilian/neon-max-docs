# Zod

Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It allows you to define schemas for your data and validate it against those schemas, ensuring type safety and robust error handling in your application.

## Why Use It in Neon Max?

- Type Safety: Ensures your data adheres to specific types, reducing runtime errors.
- Validation: Easily validate input data from forms, API responses, etc.
- Integration: Seamlessly integrates with other TypeScript libraries and tools in the starter kit. Zod is also used to quickly generate and display validation errors when used with Neon Max's `Errors` helper class.
