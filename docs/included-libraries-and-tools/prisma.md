# Prisma

Prisma is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that simplifies database access and management in your application. It generates TypeScript types based on your database schema, ensuring type-safe queries and seamless database interactions. You can easily connect with Neon's serverless Postgres database with this.

## Why Use It in Neon Max?

- Type Safety: Automatically generated types reduce the risk of database query errors.
- Database Migrations: Easily manage and apply database migrations.
- Serverless Ready: Optimized for use with serverless databases like Neon, making it a perfect fit for the starter kit.
